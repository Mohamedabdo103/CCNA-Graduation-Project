Hospital System is a well-established Network Design, which offers 
health solutions and services to its clients. The institution operates in 
two locations within the same city. Therefore, it has the following 
departments within its main headquarters Medical Lead Operation & 
Consultancy Services (MLOCS), Medical Emergency and Reporting 
(MER), Medical Records Management (MRM), Information Technology 
(IT), and Customer Service (CS). The branch hospital was designed to 
share the workloads with the headquarters hence it contains the 
following departments; Nurses & Surgery Operations (NSO), Hospital 
Labs (HL), Human resource (HR), Marketing (MK), and Finance (FIN). 
Each location is also expected to have a Guest/Waiting area (GWA) for 
patients or visitors. 
The network is expected to have a hierarchical model with two already 
purchased Core routers (one at HQ-Network and one BR-Network) each 
connecting to two subscribed ISPs. Due to security requirements, it has 
been decided that all the departments will be on a separate network 
segment within the same local area network.
